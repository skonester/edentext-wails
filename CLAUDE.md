# CLAUDE.md

Serverless, fully client-side rich-text editor that saves `.odt` and `.docx`; state lives in browser localStorage.
**Stack:** Svelte 5 (runes), TypeScript, Vite, TipTap 3 (ProseMirror), `odf-kit` and `fflate` for ODF export.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Vite dev server (hot-reload, --host)
npm run build    # production build -> dist/; npm run preview serves it
npm run desktop  # Wails desktop app in desktop/ (Go); build:desktop[:installer]; see desktop/CLAUDE.md
npm run check    # svelte-check type-check
npm test         # Vitest once (tests/**/*.test.ts)
npm run test:lo      # LibreOffice round trip, fuzz re-read, ODT/DOCX consistency (needs soffice)
npm run test:smoke   # headless dist boot; BROWSER=firefox|webkit
npm run test:dom     # browser pagination and editing; same BROWSER
npm run test:layout  # LibreOffice page counts, layout invariants and page starts
npm run test:monkey  # random editing, undo/redo and save-read invariants
npm run test:tabs    # two documents across reloads
npm run test:coverage  # Vitest V8 coverage -> coverage/index.html
npm run test:parity  # render parity; see tests/render-parity/README.md
node scripts/make-thesaurus.mjs; node scripts/collect-licenses.mjs  # re-vendor thesaurus and licenses
node scripts/showcase/run.mjs  # rebuild docs/showcase/; optional [regex] limits it
```

Tests are jsdom Vitest files outside `src/`; `npm test` covers round trips, corpus/fuzz exports, schemas and unit helpers. Browser legs share `tests/browser.mjs`; test tooling stays a `devDependency`, and CI runs `check` plus `test`.

## Rules

**Workflow**

- Read the existing code and relevant local `CLAUDE.md` before changing files.
- Follow the established architecture, naming and surrounding code style.
- Prefer the smallest correct change; do not rewrite unrelated code or add dependencies without need.
- Fix root causes rather than symptoms.
- Preserve persisted or externally consumed behaviour; add compatibility code only for a concrete need.
- Run the test legs that the final change can affect.
- Do not push unless requested.

**Comments**

- Never exceed three lines or describe/compare to an older implementation; explain only current behaviour and why.
- Do not use Word as a placeholder for a word processor; name products only for a format or product-specific quirk.

**Commit messages** — subject plus at most about eight lines. Include a short, precise bullet-point body that describes the change; put probes, measurements and rationale in architecture docs or the nearest `CLAUDE.md`.

**Document names** — never put a real-world document name in the repository or a commit message; describe the fix and measurement instead. See `tests/render-parity/README.md`.

**Defaults** — never introduce one only this editor has: importers suppress default values, so it would become direct formatting. Follow LibreOffice defaults:

- Paragraph spacing **0**; blank lines come from empty document paragraphs.
- Body **Liberation Serif 12pt**, single spacing, **2cm** margins and **1.25cm** tab/indent step.
- Headings use Arial/Liberation Sans and `HEADING_STYLE_OVERRIDES` in `styles/headings.ts`; see `docs/architecture/export.md`.
- Bundled Liberation Serif matches Times New Roman metrics; `utils/fontDetect.ts` filters picker fonts by installation.

**Layout constants** — keep `pageBreaks.ts`, `Editor.svelte` and `editor.css` aligned (`PAGE_HEIGHT` 1123px, `PAGE_GAP` 20px and `--user-page-*`/`--user-margin-*`); see `docs/architecture/pagination.md`.

**Browser testing** — use `playwright-core`, never `puppeteer`; see `docs/headless-testing.md`. Only the live app verifies rendering and NodeViews.

**Test selection** — run each relevant leg once after its input is final: unit/Vitest for logic, LibreOffice for I/O, browser legs for rendering, parity for layout.

**Naming** — components are `PascalCase.svelte`; `.ts` modules are `camelCase`; extensions are feature names such as `image.ts`.

**Documentation** — document behavioural features where they load: one line in the nearest directory `CLAUDE.md` or a section in `docs/architecture/`. This file only gains commands, hard rules and top-level directories.
