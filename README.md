> [!TIP]
> **This fork adds a Windows desktop app.** Get it from
> [Releases](https://github.com/skonester/edentext/releases): the **setup** installs
> EdenText and opens `.odt` and `.docx` files by double-click, and the **portable
> `.exe`** runs without installing. Built with [Wails](https://wails.io).

EdenText is a web-based, powerful word processor for everything from quick notes to full-length books. No server, no account — processing runs locally and your documents never leave your computer. Just one URL away, or completely offline as a slim browser app — under 2 MB on first load[^1]. The interface comes in English, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian and Chinese (simplified and traditional).

> [!NOTE]
> EdenText is young, in **beta** and actively developed — more features are on
> the way. It is tested — the full suite plus LibreOffice round-trip checks run
> on every commit — but expect occasional bugs, and keep backups of documents
> you care about. The browser copy also keeps the last three versions of the open
> document, and offers them if it ever fails to load one. What is still missing is
> listed under [Not yet implemented](CHANGELOG.md#not-yet-implemented) and
> [Known limitations](CHANGELOG.md#known-limitations).

## Features

- **Real page layout** — A4/Letter pages, margins, headers & footers, footnotes,
  columns, page and line numbering, watermarks; mirrored margins and chapters
  opening on a right-hand page for books
- **Opens and saves `.odt` and `.docx`**, exports PDF; templates (`.ott`/`.dotx`)
  and a letter gallery (DIN 5008); password-protected files in both formats
- **Plays well with Word and LibreOffice** — documents keep their layout across
  all three, backed by a sophisticated test pipeline
- **Styles** — paragraph, character, table and list styles with inheritance,
  chapter numbering
- **Tables** with styles, sorting and spreadsheet-style formulas
- **Everything a thesis needs** — table of contents, captions, cross-references,
  citations & bibliography, alphabetical index, formulas (LaTeX)
- **Review tools** — track changes and threaded comments with margin balloons,
  printable markup, spell check and synonyms (English, German, Spanish, French,
  Portuguese and Russian), grammar check (English)
- **Private by design** — your documents never leave your computer, all
  processing runs locally; works offline as an installable app. The site counts
  anonymous visits (GoatCounter, EU-hosted, no cookies); the editor sends nothing
- **Any current browser** — in Chrome and Edge, Save writes back to the opened
  file; other browsers receive each save as a download, so turn on "Always ask
  where to save" in their settings to pick the location

## Gallery

The documents behind these pictures are in [`docs/showcase/`](docs/showcase/) as `.odt`
and `.docx`, ready to open in EdenText, LibreOffice or Word. They are built by
`scripts/showcase/run.mjs`; the photographs are NASA's and the book is Lewis Carroll's,
both public domain.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # dev server with hot-reload
npm test         # test suite
npm run build    # production build → dist/
npm run build:desktop  # desktop app → desktop/build/bin/ (needs Go and the Wails CLI)
```

Built with Svelte 5, TypeScript, Vite and TipTap 3 (ProseMirror).

## Self-hosting

There is no backend and no state on the server; documents stay in the browser.
A container image is published for each release (amd64 and arm64):

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/stffnb/edentext
```

Or serve the files yourself: every release carries an `edentext-<tag>.zip` of
the built app, and `npm run build` produces the same folder in `dist/` — point
any web server at it, or build the image locally with `docker build -t edentext .`.

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Browser[Browser: local, offline-capable app] --> App[App shell and Svelte UI]
  App --> Editor[TipTap / ProseMirror editor]
  Editor <--> Document[Structured document and editor extensions]
  Document --> Layout[Styles, page layout, pagination and frames]
  Document <--> Storage[localStorage: documents, settings and recovery copies]
  Document <--> Interchange[ODT and DOCX import/export]
  Interchange --> Files[Browser file APIs, downloads and templates]
  Editor --> Tools[Spell check, grammar, formulas and review tools]
  Layout --> Render[Editable browser pages]
```

EdenText runs entirely in the browser: `App.svelte` composes the interface around
the TipTap document model and its editor extensions. Styles and layout turn that
model into editable pages; storage keeps local state and recovery copies. Import
and export translate the same model to ODT and DOCX, while browser file APIs save
or download the resulting files. See the [architecture guides](docs/architecture/)
for format and layout invariants.
